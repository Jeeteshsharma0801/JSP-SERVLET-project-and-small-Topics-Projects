ErrorHandlingProject:
In this project , we are taking 2 values from user in form defined in index.html page , and this project will divide the values and give the result to user and if any exceptioon occurs like 44/0 then divide by zero exception occurs then it will redirect to some other page and added image to that page and also exception will be shown to that error page.
and if any address given in URL is not found i.e. if any 404 error occurs , then we have handled this particular error in another different jsp page and image will be shown to that page.


TechBlog_servletJSPProject:
In this project , http://localhost:8080/TechBlog_servletJSPProject/ by this URL index.jsp page will appear , and that page we have login, signup buttons .
Upon clicking on signup button , after entering the details , information will go to the DB in "user" table.
and when clicked on "Login" button , when user will enter the email and password , it'll verify from DB "user" table , if username and password from DB is correct then , then it'll redirect to some other page i.e. profile.jsp page . 
whatever categories available in DB "categories" table , will be available on left side and right side all the posts will be available from DB "posts" table.
if any user logged in and like the post , then that like entry will goto DB "liked" table.
also we have given the "Logout" Button , when user click that logout button , the session will expire and user get logged out.

Connection made with Mysql with schemaName=techblogproject , username=root , password=Jeet0801@ in connectionProvider.java file.

we have used categories , liked , posts , user tables in DB with primary key as user id , postid , catID , likeid and foreign keys catid, userid etc.
